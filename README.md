Make a music queue using telegram and wired speaker
This script allows you to connect your telegram bot to your wired speaker.
Script will make a directory listing and show all the songs with their respective index.
After that you will be able to send the index via telegram to the bot and it will start playing that.
By sending more indexes (codes), new songs will be inserted into the queue and will start playing when the previous one ends.
Hope you will like it.
Peace out!
